# CoinBase
Application for cryptocurrencies.
On the main screen, we can select cryptocurrency and check its current price. Below there is a simple calculator that can change dollars for selected cryptocurrency, or inverted when selected invert switch. If you click the "Check history charts" button there will be a view showing history charts with the cryptocurrency price in selected time, you can select time using buttons at the top.

UI - Fully created programmatically

API - Used coinranking.com API (it has some issues tho)

JSON - Parsing data to created model using Codable

MVC - Used MVC pattern when creating the application
